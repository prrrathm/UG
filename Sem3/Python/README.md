    1. Password Matching - Get password from user, authenticate if password is 'magic' then print succcessful login else print wrong password (message has to be returned)
    
    2. Moderate Function - in main function input marks of a students and moderate them as following - 
    if marks > 40 ~ do nothing
    if marks are between 35-39 : moderate them to 40
    if marks < 35 ~ do nothing

    3. Maximum out of 3 - Input 3 numbers and print the biggest number out of

    WAP a main () to take a choice from user to printright triangle orinverted triangle.Enter the number of rows to be printed for right triangleor invertedtriangle.Pass this number of rows from main to rightTriangle()orinvertedItriangle() depending on users' choiceand print the triangle from the called function.

    Practical Questions 1-5
    1. Write a function that takes the lengths of three sides : side1, side2 and side3 of the triangle as the input from the user using input function and  return the area and perimeter of the triangle as a tuple. Also, assert that sum of the length of any two sides is greater than the third side.
    2. Consider a showroom of electronic products, where there are various salesmen. Each salesman is given a commission of 5%, depending on the sales made per month In case the sale done is less than 50,000, then the salesman is not given any commission. Write a function to calculate total sales of a salesman in a month, commission and remarks for the salesman. Sales done by each salesman per week is to be provided as input. Use tuples/list to store data of salesmen. Assign remarks according to the following criteria:
        1. Excellent:Sales>=80000
        2. Good:Sales>=60000and<80000
        3. Average:Sales>=40000and<60000
        4. WorkHard:Sales<40000
    3. Write a Python function to find the nth term of Fibonacci sequence and its factorial. Return the result as a list.
    4. Write a function that takes a number (>=10)as an input and return the digits of the number as a set.
    5. Write a function that finds the sum of the n terms of the following series.Import the factorial function created in question 4.
        1. 1–x2/2!+x4/4!–x6/6!+...xn/n!
